Sniffing Attack using Wireshark
üìçTarget Site: http://testphp.vulnweb.com
Statement: I had the opportunity to study and utilize the Wireshark packet analysis tool to gain a deeper understanding of its functionality.
Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer, is an essential tool for network troubleshooting and analysis
A sniffing attack involves intercepting and capturing data packets as they travel across a network. Attackers can analyze these packets to obtain valuable information, such as login credentials, personal data, or financial details.
My specific focus was on deciphering the methods employed to extract usernames and passwords from an HTTP website.
I extend my heartfelt appreciation to TechnoHacks EduTech Official and Sandip Gavit for generously providing me with this invaluable opportunity, which allowed me to enhance my cybersecurity skills.
